class Hash():
    """
    Abstract base class for implementing hash-based nearest neighbors search algorithms. This class defines
    the interface for hashing data points and queries, building the index for fast nearest neighbor searches,
    and performing the actual search. Concrete implementations must provide functionality for these operations,
    tailored to specific hashing techniques.

    Methods:
        hash_data(self, data: np.array) -> np.array:
            Hashes the input data into a lower-dimensional space for efficient similarity search.

        hash_query(self, query: np.array) -> np.array:
            Hashes the query point(s) into the same lower-dimensional space as the data for comparison.

        nns(self, param: T) -> List[IdxVal]:
            Performs a nearest neighbor search, returning the closest data points to the query.

        build_index(self, data: np.array):
            Constructs the index from the input dataset to enable fast nearest neighbor searches.

        """
        Hashes the input data points into a lower-dimensional representation, which is used for
        building the index and performing efficient similarity searches.

        Parameters:
            data (np.array): The high-dimensional data points to be hashed, typically as a 2D numpy array
                             where each row is a data point.

        Returns:
            np.array: The hashed representation of the input data, usually in a lower-dimensional space.

        Hashes the query point(s) into the same lower-dimensional space as the dataset to facilitate
        comparison and nearest neighbor search.

        Parameters:
            query (np.array): The query point(s) to be hashed, which may be a single data point or multiple
                              points in a 2D array format.

        Returns:

        Performs a nearest neighbor search to find the closest points in the dataset to the given query.

        Parameters:
            param (T): The query parameter, typically encapsulating the query point(s) and possibly
                       additional search parameters specific to the concrete implementation.

        Returns:
            List[IdxVal]: A list of IdxVal objects, each representing a data point (by index) and its
                          distance or similarity measure to the query. The list is usually ordered by
                          increasing distance or decreasing similarity.

    def build_index(self, data: np.array):

        Parameters:

                             row represents a data point.
