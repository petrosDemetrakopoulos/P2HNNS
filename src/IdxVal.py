class IdxVal:
    """
    Represents an ordered pair consisting of an index and a value, where ordering is primarily based on the value, 
    and secondarily (in case of equal values) on the index. This class supports comparison operations allowing 
    objects of this class to be sorted or compared directly.

    Attributes:
        idx (int): The index part of the ordered pair.
        value (Any): The value part of the ordered pair, can be of any type that supports comparison operations.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, idx, value): Initializes a new instance of IdxVal.
        __eq__(self, other): Checks equality between this object and another based on their values and indices.
        __lt__(self, other): Defines the less-than ordering between this object and another.
        __repr__(self): Returns an unambiguous string representation of this object.

        Initializes a new instance of the IdxVal class with the specified index and value.

        Parameters:
            idx (int): The index associated with the value.
            value (Any): The value to be associated with the index. Can be of any type that supports comparison.

        Checks if this IdxVal object is equal to another, based on both the value and the index. Equality is 
        achieved when both the value and the index are equal.

        Parameters:
            other (IdxVal): The other IdxVal object to compare with.
